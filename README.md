# Advent of Code 2017

https://adventofcode.com/2017

My version of the first 15 days of AoC2017 in Node.
I wanted to improve my skills and see how far I could go by using Node as the main programming language.

I included some notes and thoughts about my approach for each problem and tried to keep the code readable and organized.

Any feedback is appreciated!
